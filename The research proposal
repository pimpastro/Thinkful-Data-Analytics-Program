The research proposal

DRILL: Make a quick research proposal
Write up the essential points of a research proposal for an improved version of that experiment.

Does a new supplement help people sleep better?
The problem
This is where you define the question or problem, justify why the problem should be studied, and review what we already know about the problem. 

People have problems with sleeping.  As we know not enough sleep can be the cause of different problems. So we decided to solve this problem with supplements. 
The potential solution
Here you propose a hypothesis (potential explanation) to be tested. 

We have improved the old supplement with a new one and want to make sure they work better. 
The method of testing the solution
Describe the design of the experiment, the _analysis plan_, and _set benchmarks_:

At first, I will do A/A test to make sure I will not get bias. For this test, we will need a group of people that don’t take any medicine but wants to improve a sleeping thing.

We will need about 300 people of male and females 40-50 years old. We will split them into 3 groups.
At first, we will do A/A test to make sure the samples are close to the population and we don’t have a bias. 
Then we will do A/B tests: the first group will take old supplements, the second group takes new supplements, and the third one will take a placebo. 
Doing this test people will get their own supplements for 2-3 months and ware the sleeping tracking device (smartwatch). 
The key metric is one of those: awakes, REM, Light or Deep sleep. Duration of sleep (how many hours). how long did it take for patients to fall asleep?
