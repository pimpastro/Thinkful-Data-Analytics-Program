Bias and A/A testing

Assignments:

For each of the following scenarios, call out the potential biases in the proposed experiment. Do your best to try to discover not only the bias, but the initial design. There is plenty of room for interpretation here, so make sure to state what assumptions you're making.

You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.
Potential biases: February is very far for swimming season. In May you can expect more clients for “beach” type swim suits but in February more “sport” type for indoor lessons. 

You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.
Because people without anxiety (or not related to people with anxiety) have no reason to visit this type of clinic.

You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.
A new billboard takes some attention. But we need more than just 1 week to get solid results.

You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.
It depends on the rules and requirements of the program. Does it require registration or just purchases? I need more context.
